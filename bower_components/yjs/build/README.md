### build/browser
You find the browserified (not minified) version of yjs here. This is nice for debugging, since it also includes sourcemaps. For production, however, you should use the version that you find in the main directory.

### build/node
Yjs for nodejs is located here. You can only use the submodules, or require 'y' in your node project. Also works with browserify.

### build/test
Start build/test/index.html' in your browser, to perform testing Yjs.
